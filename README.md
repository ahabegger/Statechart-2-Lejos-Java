# Statechart-2-Lejos-Java
### Alexander J. Habegger

This Java application is designed to control a rover using EV3 motors and sensors. It includes functionalities for moving the rover, detecting objects with ultrasonic sensors, and identifying colors.

## Features
- Control motors for forward and backward movement.
- Rotate the rover left or right.
- Use ultrasonic sensors to detect proximity to objects.
- Identify colors with a color sensor.

## Setup
1. Ensure you have Java and the leJOS EV3 library installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Compile and deploy the code to your EV3 robot.

## Usage
The main class `Rover` controls the rover's movement based on sensor inputs. Customize the behavior by modifying the state-handling logic.
