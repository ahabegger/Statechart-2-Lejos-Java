# Statechart-2-Lejos-Java
### Alexander J. Habegger

A Python program that conducts a M2M transformation. The program converts the input model of a statechart diagram in MDJ file format to the output model of Java code meant to execute the statechart for the Lejos programmable robot.

## Potential State and Transitions
- Control motors for forward and backward movement.
- Rotate the rover left or right.
- Use ultrasonic sensors to detect proximity to objects.
- Identify colors with a color sensor.

## Setup Output Code
1. Ensure you have Java Eclipse and the leJOS EV3 library installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Compile and deploy the code to your EV3 robot.
